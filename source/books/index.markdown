<h2>Favourite or Interesting Books</h2>

<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1283557358&amp;sr=8-1" title="Clean Code" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Clean Code" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l86znhVlP81qd3y5s.jpg"/></a>Clean Code is one of a small selection of books that really seems to have captured the ideas needed to keep code from being designed and developed poorly. It will help you both detect and prevent code rot.</p>

<p>Bob Martin has been around long enough, along with people like Martin Fowler to have the experience needed to write a book like this. It’s one of those core books that every developer should read, and re-read.</p>


<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Department-Mad-Scientists-Michael-Belfiore/dp/0061577936/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267302226&amp;sr=8-1" title="Department of Mad Scientists" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Department of Mad Scientists" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VMw1X5FSof0/S4mA0gajQ2I/AAAAAAAAAJE/X0R8NZnxyuE/s320/MadScientists.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>In the Department of Mad Scientists, the author take you through a fascinating look at DARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. You may not have heard of DARPA, but among other things, they funded and helped develop something that today is called the Internet… If you have an interest in how big (outlandish) ideas get turned into a reality when no one else in the world even thinks it’s possible, read this book :-).</p>


<p><strong>Fiction</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0451228731/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1283557602&amp;sr=1-1" title="Daemon" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Daemon" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l870fhJOTs1qd3y5s.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>When this book came out, it quickly became one of my favourite books of all time. It’s up there with Cryptonomicon and Neuromancer. I won’t give any spoilers, but if you liked Cryptonomicon, you’ll probably like this. The author is a techie who has worked in the industry, with some of the larger companies. He has a good grasp on current and near-future tech.</p>
