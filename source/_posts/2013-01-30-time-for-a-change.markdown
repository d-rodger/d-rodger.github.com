<p>
	The first, and obvious: a new blog layout. In fact, I am moving this blog to github (and will change devslant.com to point to it shortly).
</p>

<p>
	In addition, I've decided not to keep all the previous blog posts, though they could be imported fairly easily.
</p>

<p><strong>
	Career Change
</p></strong>

<p>
	This week marks the first week I am no longer at <a href="http://corp.airg.com">airG</a>. It was a great run over 8 years (with ups and downs), but now I am looking for a new adventure! And if anything, the field of software development has only gotten more exciting.
</p>

<p>
	Last year was when I really took an interest in the whole nosql area, along with node.js. This year is MOAR! I expect Perl is not what I will end up working with any longer, at least not for a majority of the software most companies want developed.The JVM-based languages look really interesting, I recently picked up 'Land of Lisp', and may even do some old-school C again. I find more and more that I want to know the features of most languages, and be able to use a mix, with a concentration of one or two.
</p>

<p>
	As an example of the awesome things to progress further with (and I will blog about):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>CassandraDB</li>
	<li>Couchbase 2.x</li>
	<li>elasticsearch</li>
	<li>M2M (Machine-to-Machine)</li>
	<li>Virtualization</li>
	<li>Algorithms</li>
	<li>logstash</li>
	<li>Storm</li>
	<li>ZooKeeper</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are also several key papers that I have been reading (and will blog these too):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unified Logging Infrastructure for Data Analytics at Twitter</li>
	<li>Volcano - An Extensible and Parallel Query Evaluation System</li>
	<li>Sagas</li>
	<li>Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data</li>
	<li>Dynamo: AMAzon's Highly Available Key-value Store</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Many others of course, but this is part of my initial list.
