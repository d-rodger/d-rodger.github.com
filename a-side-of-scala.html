    I've been investing time in a few different technologies and programming languages lately. One of the languages that has surprised me is Scala. I'd heard about it, even took a peek at it many years ago, and promptly went on to other things. However, after meeting with Jeremy Pierre <a href="http://noisycode.com" title="NoiseCode" target="_blank">(noisycode.com/)</a> from HootSuite, I decided to take another look at it. 
</p>

<p>
    Scala has come a long way, and it seems to be poised for some real growth. I began with the usual, a quick google, wandering through some scala dedicated sites, StackOverflow and Reddit posts. I came across a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" title="Coursera" target="_blank">Coursera</a> (already signed up), and have begun reading Cay Horstmann's Scala for the Impatient.
</p>

<p>
    Scala makes you wish this is what Java had turned into. Scala runs on top of the JVM, so it's doing what the JVM + Java would be capable of, if only Java had gone towards this path.
</p>

<p>
    I think what has surprised me most about Scala so far, are the parts that seem like Perl to me. I know, shocking right? Scala similar to Perl? Scala has much higher information density that Java - you get more done per line of code. I always found Perl to have a high information density too. Quite often, Scala will infer what 'type' you want. You can declare values as lazy (which is one of the features the Perl Moose framework provides)
</p>

<p>
    I've only just begun with Scala, and my views may very well change as I learn more about it. For now, it seems like an interesting (but growing) niche. There is a Vancouver meetup group - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-scala/" title="scala" target="_blank">Vancouver Scala</a>. Hopefully there will be some meetups and presentations there soon.
