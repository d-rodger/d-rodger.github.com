Title: Small blog changes

<p>
Once again, it's been a very log time since I have posted anything.
</p>

<p>
I've changed what I use behind the scenes to generate this blog. Since I switched to hosting it on GitHub, I've been using Octopress to generate the site. Octopress is developed in Ruby, and gets updated about as often as I update my blog...
</p>

<p>
Since I don't use Ruby (I'm all about Python now), and I wanted something that was still being developed, I've switched the site to using Pelican, which will allow me to use my Python knowledge to customize as I go.
