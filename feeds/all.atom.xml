&lt;p&gt;I've been a long time user of Gmail. I use my gmail address for...well, everything that you need an email address for. But there's a downside to using a free service like Gmail. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are the product - or more specfically data about you is the product - and it's being packaged and sold over and over and over...and it's also being scooped up by governments for 'security' (but really, domestic surveillance). Of course, governments contract that stuff out, so it's really...anyone could be accessing your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what to do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, I am pulling away from services like Gmail, DropBox, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've signed up with a few email providers, and will likely stick with 1-2 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://protonmail.com"&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; is in Switzerland. They provide encrypted email, and by that I mean the contents of your emails are stored encrypted, and your connection to ProtonMail is encrypted. Your emails are decrypted in your browser, so that's the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; place where anything can be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails sent to other ProtonMail users are of course encrypted, but what about sending an email to someone outside of ProtonMail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what happens is when the email from ProtonMail is sent, it actually just sends a special link back to ProtonMail, to where the email can be read &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you have the password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you get the password to read this email? That's where you have to have agreed to a password with the person who sent the email to you. A little bit cumbersome, at least the first time, but otherwise it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular, unencrypted emails can still be sent to you, so you can stil get regular email sent to you, but at least once it's in ProtonMail's system, it's safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found the Android client (currently in beta) to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutanota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tutanota.com"&gt;Tutanota&lt;/a&gt; is in Germany. Like ProtonMail, they provide end-to-end encrypted email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use the same mechanism as ProtonMail, ie a link is sent to where the encrypted email can be read, as long as you have the password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I like both of these services. The provide both a free option as well as a paid version that provides more storage space (and that oh-so-good feeling of helping to support what are worthy businesses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also trying out &lt;a href="https://whiteout.io"&gt;whiteout.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.openmailbox.org"&gt;openmailbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep gmail around, if only for having a junk email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text editor for those who want speed and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a long-time user of vim (and have dabbled with emacs). But it's really only been the last 2-3 years that I have make a serious commitment to learning more of vim's features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I had gotten my vim configuration to where I didn't need any further changes (ahahaha). Then I began to feel like vim was slowing down. Trying to run lint checkers would cause vim to block. What I wanted in an editor, vim no longer seemed to have. Emacs began to look like an option...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I helped support a vim fork - &lt;a href="https://neovim.io/"&gt;neovim&lt;/a&gt;. It's goals were to clean up large portions of the vim code, and put asynchronous support in (among other features). Well, fast-forward to this month, and I've switched to using neovim completely. Surprisingly, I now use fewer plugins, but with greater effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neovim feels consistently faster than vim, and some of the quirks with screen redraws seem to be gone in neovim. The neomake plugin that allows for asynchronous tasks is awesome. Running python linters in the background is faster than running them in vim ever was. It's impressive how much better neovim is than vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the additional features - a built in terminal - is something I thought I wouldn't use, since I start everything within tmux sessions, but I was wrong. Being able to pull in text from the terminal straight into neovim is something I have quickly become used to having available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried using vim, or you are a very experienced vim user, give neovim a try. It's much faster, has additional features and it supports almost all of the existing vim plugins.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="neovim"></category><category term="vim"></category></entry><entry><title>Small blog changes</title><link href="http://devslant.com/small-blog-changes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-11T05:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Derek Rodger</name></author><id>tag:devslant.com,2015-05-11:small-blog-changes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Once again, it's been a very log time since I have posted anything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've changed what I use behind the scenes to generate this blog. Since I switched to hosting it on GitHub, I've been using Octopress to generate the site. Octopress is developed in Ruby, and gets updated about as often as I update my blog...
&lt;/p&gt;

Since I don't use Ruby (I'm all about Python now), and I wanted something that was still being developed, I've switched the site to using Pelican, which will allow me to use my Python knowledge to customize as I go.

&lt;p&gt;Ever find yourself with a project or task to do, but not the motivation to start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It becomes easy to find distractions doesn't it? You're brain is trying to find ways to avoid the small amount of displeasure it experiences getting started on something, especially something difficult. But there are ways to encourage your brain. Let's focus on the Pomodoro Technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The idea is to use a timer, and work for 25 minutes and then take a small break, where you reward yourself. The reward is important, because it gives you motivation and encouragement for getting through the 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="top" alt='pomodoro flow' src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133191/Pomodoro_flow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four pomodoro sessions, take a longer break after the fourth one. Thirty minutes is the usual recommendation. Now this doesn't mean to stop working. Instead switch to another task, now check your emails or arrange those meetings that you avoided while you were in your pomodori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this technique particularly useful at work. I can determine which task I am going to work on, set a timer on the computer, and focus on it - no email, no news feeds - just concentration on the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you're eager to learn, you have passion for a subject, all you need to do is dive in, spend eight hours a day learning it, and you'll be an expert, right? Not quite... As I mentioned in the last article about Spaced Repetition, your brain needs time to actually grow and link the neural pathways that will store information. It's not just spacing between reviews that you need. You need to unfocus to learn too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(Un)focussed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="top" alt="focus" src="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133191/internet-marketing-business.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I learn faster if I'm not focused?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that you don't focus, it's that you don't try to spend all your time focused. Focus is still needed, it's how we initially get the information into our brains. Concentrating, absorbing information, really applying your mind on something challenging is strengthening your mind. But like building muscles, you need to rest, because that's when the actual gains are made.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever notice that when you are working on a difficult problem, and you go for a walk, or maybe a drive, or just do something that takes your mind off what you were working on, that you suddenly have an idea pop into your head that solves the problem? Wouldn't it be great if that happened more often? What you want is to relax your mind in what's called diffuse mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Diffusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="top" alt="stay on target" src="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133191/Blausen_0315_diffusion.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is diffuse mode, and what's happening when your in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diffuse mode occurs when you are not concentrating (focusing) on something in particular. It's when you are relaxed, and able to think about things from a high-level, rather than buried amongst the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does diffuse mode help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are in this mode of thinking, your brain is still working on the problem, but now that your not focussed on the details, your brain is able to start connecting what you're learning with other knowledge you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If you are grappling with a new concept or trying to solve a new problem, you don't have preexisting neural patterns to help guide your thoughts"&lt;/em&gt; - Barbara Oakley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when diffuse mode helps. It pulls together knowledge you have with the information you are learning, combining them in new ways. When you are focused on something, diffuse mode is blocked. By taking a break (say, every 25 minutes, which I'll talk about in another post), you allow the diffuse mode to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing from my last post about &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/learning-001" target="_blank"&gt;Learning How to Learn&lt;/a&gt;, this time I want to turn my focus to another effective technique for recalling and reviewing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spaced repetition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, when learning something make the mistake of attempting to learn it all at once ('cramming'). I've been guilty of doing this in the past :-). I'm a fast reader, and I used to retain a fair amount of what I read on the first past (or at least, *I* thought so). This may allow you to hold onto the information long enough to recall it shortly afterwards, but for true, deep understanding, it's a poor way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="top" alt="cramming" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133191/cramming-cramming-everywhere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brain needs time to create the neurological connections, to grow the new dendrites after learning. This doesn't happen all at once, so trying to stuff everything into your brain in one session won't work. You're just overfilling your working memory. So what is a good technique for learning something, for really understanding it in depth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing yourself to remember something, almost relearning it, after a gap or 'space' from when you first learned it is very useful for improving. Spaced repetition is the idea that if you review material at different intervals, ranging from minutes after you first learned it, to days, weeks, even months, then you will have stored it permanently and will be able to recall it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want to do is go from the short time - for example: reading a page of a book, then closing it and attempting to recall what that page was about, to writing down what you recall and understand about the material later that same day, to then recalling the material a few days later, and then extending that out to many days/weeks/months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use flash cards to help you review, or if you prefer software, there is &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, which is spaced repetition software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works because you want to practice recalling the information not just the moment after you have read/watched/heard something, but again &lt;strong&gt;just before&lt;/strong&gt; you are about to forget it. Practicing like this at spaced intervals allows you to extend how long you retain the information, and increases your understandng. Your neural pathways expand, make more connections, and can lead you to being more creative as you see other uses and related ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I began an online course through &lt;a href="https://coursera.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/learning-001" target="_blank"&gt;Learning How to Learn&lt;/a&gt;. I've been interested in advances in neuroscience for awhile, and some of that field has concentrated on trying to understand how people learn, what works, and what doesn't. Learning How to Learn, taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski brings together the latest information in the field. Using clear explanations and examples, they have put together a four-week course that provides incredibly useful techniques for improving your learning and deepening your understanding of topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this course, there is an assignment to help deepen your understanding of the material by explaining and educating others about some of the topics in the course. This blog post (and some future ones) is part of that assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Teaching as Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd heard the phrase "The best way to learn something is to teach it" before, but is it true? And if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we teach, we learn", said Roman philosopher Seneca. What is now called the "protege effect", students who taught others scored higher on tests than those learning on their own. Teaching forces you to work harder to understand the material, allowing you to recall it more accurately and apply it more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, the very act of writing this blog post, recalling information from the course and other sources and attempting to explain it helps increase my &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; understanding of the topic. Attempting to recall and explain something strengthens the neurological connections in the brain. Improving through teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from scratch, it's something developers should be used to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I started a new job at &lt;a href="http://www.erezlife.com" target="_blank"&gt;eRezLife&lt;/a&gt;. I consider myself fortunate to have landed in a small company where I can make an impact, and each and every person is great to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what's so deep about that? We're just starting to migrate from a PHP code base (that's where I'm treading at the moment) to Python + Django where I will be diving in as deep as I can, along with learning more JavaScript and jQuery. I've spent 8½ years working with Perl (with the last few years spent in modern Perl with Moose). I can truly say I am happy for a change, and really want to absorb the concepts within Python, not just the syntax and some libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Completely unrelated to programming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a new road bike. I've ridden the same bike for nearly 8 years, and it's just not comfortable. Trust me when I say, get a bike fitting before you buy a bike. Plus the technology in bikes has improved quite a bit during this time, and the carbon fiber in the frames these days is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my new ride. Why yes, that &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; a &lt;a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en/projectone#model/domane6series" target="_blank"&gt;ProjectOne&lt;/a&gt; bike :-). This pic is really what it looks like, since ProjectOne lets you customize the parts and colors. Part of my plan for next year is to ride in some of the Gran Fondo's (Grand Rides). Either (or both):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    I've been investing time in a few different technologies and programming languages lately. One of the languages that has surprised me is Scala. I'd heard about it, even took a peek at it many years ago, and promptly went on to other things. However, after meeting with Jeremy Pierre &lt;a href="http://noisycode.com" title="NoiseCode" target="_blank"&gt;(noisycode.com/)&lt;/a&gt; from HootSuite, I decided to take another look at it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Scala has come a long way, and it seems to be poised for some real growth. I began with the usual, a quick google, wandering through some scala dedicated sites, StackOverflow and Reddit posts. I came across a course on &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" title="Coursera" target="_blank"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; (already signed up), and have begun reading Cay Horstmann's Scala for the Impatient.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Scala makes you wish this is what Java had turned into. Scala runs on top of the JVM, so it's doing what the JVM + Java would be capable of, if only Java had gone towards this path.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    I think what has surprised me most about Scala so far, are the parts that seem like Perl to me. I know, shocking right? Scala similar to Perl? Scala has much higher information density that Java - you get more done per line of code. I always found Perl to have a high information density too. Quite often, Scala will infer what 'type' you want. You can declare values as lazy (which is one of the features the Perl Moose framework provides)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    I've only just begun with Scala, and my views may very well change as I learn more about it. For now, it seems like an interesting (but growing) niche. There is a Vancouver meetup group - &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-scala/" title="scala" target="_blank"&gt;Vancouver Scala&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully there will be some meetups and presentations there soon.

    The first, and obvious: a new blog layout. In fact, I am moving this blog to github (and will change devslant.com to point to it shortly).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    In addition, I've decided not to keep all the previous blog posts, though they could be imported fairly easily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
    Career Change
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This week marks the first week I am no longer at &lt;a href="http://corp.airg.com"&gt;airG&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great run over 8 years (with ups and downs), but now I am looking for a new adventure! And if anything, the field of software development has only gotten more exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Last year was when I really took an interest in the whole nosql area, along with node.js. This year is MOAR! I expect Perl is not what I will end up working with any longer, at least not for a majority of the software most companies want developed.The JVM-based languages look really interesting, I recently picked up 'Land of Lisp', and may even do some old-school C again. I find more and more that I want to know the features of most languages, and be able to use a mix, with a concentration of one or two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    As an example of the awesome things to progress further with (and I will blog about):

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been trying out &lt;a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" 
title="Cassandra" target="_blank"&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt; @ work. Just recently I took a 
webinar that &lt;a href="http://www.datastax.com/" title="DataStax" 
target="_blank"&gt;DataStax&lt;/a&gt; hosted (the commercial company behind Cassandra), 
and conducted by Tim Berglund (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tlberglund" 
title="twitter" target="_blank"&gt;@tlberglund&lt;/a&gt;). The webinars introduce 
Cassandra for developers and operations. A great way to get started 
understanding what Cassandra does, and doesn&amp;#8217;t do. (Tim&amp;#8217;s 
training videos on O&amp;#8217;Reilly are excellent by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra is a schema-less, scalable, distributed database. There&amp;#8217;s
actually more to it than that, but the list of it&amp;#8217;s capabilities is rather
long :-). Surprisingly, it&amp;#8217;s also relatively easy to setup. I found the
setup process simpler than earilier versions of MySQL, yet you get far more from
a brief configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single node setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a single node of Cassandra is straight forward, but it is handy to
have some notes in one place, since there may be some additional files you need
to download if you want some of the features provided by the &lt;a
href="http://www.datastax.com/products/opscenter" title="OpsCenter"
target="_blank"&gt;OpsCenter&lt;/a&gt; package that DataStax makes available for
monitoring your Cassandra cluster. More about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, decide if you want the Apache version (no OpsCenter available with
this version) or the DataStax Community version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra runs on the JVM, so make sure you have a version of the Java
runtime environment. I&amp;#8217;ve tested with both Oracle Java 6 &amp;amp; 7. The
OpenJDK is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; recommended. One caveat about Java 7 below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be using the DataStax Community edition, which at this time is
v1.1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve downloaded the version for your OS, go ahead and install
it. I&amp;#8217;m using the tarball: dsc-cassandra-1.1.0-bin.tar.gz &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit your &lt;strong&gt;conf/cassandra.yaml&lt;/strong&gt;
file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;initial_token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can set this to 0 for a
single node, but read the notes below if you setup a cluster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide where you want your data files,
commit log, and cache to be saved to. Needs to be a path you have permissions to
read/write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seeds, listen_address, rpc_address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can leave these
as the defaults, but you&amp;#8217;ll want to change these for cluster
configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the version of Cassandra you are
running with Java 7, the initial amount of memory set for the stack space
appears to be too small. (it works fine with v1.1.0). However, if you run into
an error from the JVM about memory, change the following line in
&lt;strong&gt;conf/cassandra-env.sh&lt;/strong&gt; (near line
153):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;JVM_OPTS=&amp;#8221;$JVM_OPTS -Xss128k&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br/&gt;and change it
to&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;JVM_OPTS=&amp;#8221;$JVM_OPTS -Xss160k&amp;#8221; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this
point, you can go ahead and try running Cassandra:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bin/cassandra
-f&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will run it in the foreground, allowing you to see
any errors. &lt;br/&gt;If you scroll through the output, you will see two items not
available:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br/&gt;JNA not found. Native methods will be
disabled.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br/&gt;Will not load MX4J, mx4j-tools.jar is not in the
classpath &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features (JNA and mx4j) can be downloaded and installed to the
cassandra/lib path by getting them from:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mx4j/files/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mx4j/files/"
target="_blank"&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mx4j/files/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
href="https://github.com/twall/jna" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a
href="https://github.com/twall/jna"
target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/twall/jna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need the mx4j-tools.jar from the mx4j project.&lt;br/&gt;You need the jna.jar
and platform.jar for JNA support.&lt;br/&gt;Once you have the jar files copied, stop
and then restart Cassandra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming no errors, at this point you have a working Cassandra node. You can
go ahead and create a keyspace (database), and column families (tables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mostly a repeat of the single node setup. Install and configure
Cassandra on your other nodes, but this time you will be filling in the config
section for &amp;#8216;seeds&amp;#8217; by adding a few of the IPs from the other nodes.
This allows the nodes to start talking to each other, and learn the topology of
the network. You don&amp;#8217;t need to include all the other nodes, just enough
for the cluster to start talking to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;initial_token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You really want to set the inital_token
for &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; node you are installing to. As noted in the conf file, poorly
chosen tokens will lead to hotspots for your data. There is a site available for
generating tokens depending on the number of nodes you have &lt;a
href="http://rickbranson.com/tokenguy.html" title="Token Guy"
target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned above, you will want to add some of
the IP addresses of the other nodes (even if those nodes are simply running in a
virtual machine). Modify this line, and make sure the list of IPs is within the
quotes:&lt;br/&gt;seeds: &amp;#8220;192.168.10.100, 192.168.10.101,
192.168.10.103&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;listen_address:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set this to the local host IP address
(the address that you will be configuring some of the other nodes to talk
to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rpc_address:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I set this to the same IP as I&amp;#8217;m
using for the listen_address - the local host IP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point, the node is ready to become
part of a cluster. You will need to perform all of the single node and cluster
setup as described above on each node that you want as part of the cluster. Go
ahead and start up your Cassandra instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpsCenter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this:&lt;img alt="opscenter" height="468"
src="http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/opsc-multi-cluster.jpg"
width="900"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://www.datastax.com/products/opscenter"
title="OpsCenter" target="_blank"&gt;OpsCenter&lt;/a&gt;. This is pretty cool. The
OpsCenter is your dashboard, allowing you to setup, modify, observe and maintain
your Cassandra cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpsCenter setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to the OpsCenter, as far as configuration goes:&lt;br/&gt;The
OpsCenter itself&lt;br/&gt;The agent that sends data to the OpsCenter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You
only need the OpsCenter running on one server, but you need the agent running on
each node, so that it can feed information to the OpsCenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;conf/opscenterd.conf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set the &lt;em&gt;interface&lt;/em&gt; value to
your local host IP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also turned off ssl, since I&amp;#8217;m just setting this up as a test cluster
using several virtual machines, by adding this under [agents]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[agents]&lt;br/&gt;use_ssl = false &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agent/conf/address.yaml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can create this by running
the bin/setup program, but for a simple entry, you can just create it yourself.
One difference here, will be the &amp;#8216;stomp_interface&amp;#8217; - this is the IP
address of the server where you want to run the OpsCenter. The agents on all
nodes should be using the same OpsCenter IP address to talk to. Also note that
here also, I&amp;#8217;ve turned off ssl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;stomp_interface: &amp;#8220;192.168.10.100&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;use_ssl: 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to setup the agent configuration on each node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run the agent:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agent/bin/opscenter-agent -f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To turn on the OpsCenter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bin/opscenter -f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then use your browser to connect to the IP address that you configured
OpsCenter to use, via port 8888.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all has gone well, at this point you have Cassandra and OpsCenter up
and running, and you can see your cluster. Time to start creating keyspaces
(databases) and column families (tables). Then look into CQL :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend the #cassandra channel on freenode for questions, and the
documentation on the DataStax site is extensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cassandra"></category><category term="datastax"></category><category term="nosql"></category><category term="opscenter"></category><category term="Tim Berglund"></category></entry><entry><title>"Catching up with the future"</title><link href="http://devslant.com/catching-up-with-the-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-17T16:26:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Derek Rodger</name></author><id>tag:devslant.com,2012-05-17:catching-up-with-the-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things that started happening @work in the last year is that more
developers within the company began looking to use a wider (and more recent)
selection of technology. @work has been running for years on a LAMP (Linux, 
Apache 1.3x, MySQL, Perl) stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a move to JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for front-end development, and
node.js for some of the back-end infrastructure, there have been opportunities
to try new languages, databases, caches, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any group of people picking new technology, sometimes you pick wisely. 
Other times…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you don’t know what your choice means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MongoDB" height="100" width="225" src="http://media.mongodb.org/logo-mongodb.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 8 months ago, one project team was facing a high volume of reads 
(and a fairly high volume of writes). They decided to try using MongoDB for 
storing their data. They went through some rough outages, but managed to 
persevere and got it working (and it still works). However, sometimes success 
makes everything look like it can be solved the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some features that were meant only for paying users. This is where things quickly got painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They used MongoDB to also store whether or not the user had paid, and should therefore be granted access to additional content and features. There was already a billing system that stored this information, but they wanted to cache the billing access in MongoDB. Some of you will already be thinking of the ways this can go wrong, but for now I’m not going to focus on the risks of having data and responsibilities being duplicated across different platforms. Instead I’ll focus on the disadvantage of using MongoDB for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular use case, with MongoDB’s eventual consistency, users could have successfully paid, but depending on which MongoDB node the requests came to immediately after purchasing, the node may or may not have the updated data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB isn’t where you want to store this kind of information. You need your view of billing data to be consistent 100% of the time. Imagine if you 
occasionally lost access to your TV channels because the system storing your
billing state wasn’t consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t like it when you mess up the access they have paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed and consistency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Redis" height="100" width="200" src="http://redis.io/images/redis.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since it was now impacting users for something they had paid for, I became involved from the billing side of @work. Myself and another developer (from the Integrations team) volunteered to take care of it. We were faced with a few problems:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The technical - data needed to be accessed frequently (about 4,000 - 5,000 queries per second with higher volumes expected), and had to be consistent each time.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;There was no documentation on what had been done or how the product was supposed to work. Argh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, the actual amount of data to store was small, and could easily fit into memory. This is where we could have used memcache. We already had memcache in use in other areas of the company infrastructure, so it would be easy to spin up another instance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After a bit of research though, we decided to use Redis. Aside from being ridiculously fast (testing showed it capable of 100,000 queries per second on our servers), it supports storing data structures such as hashes, sets, sorted sets, and lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, Redis was easy to work with. Compared to the rest of the code we needed to change, suddenly the data store and it’s performance was no longer a concern. Redis just worked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since moving the data over to Redis and ensuring that the billing system was responsible for updating it, I can say that Redis has been completely solid for us. Billions and billions of hits, no downtime, reasonably easy to slave and support for fail-over with persistence to disk. Our customers now have a correct, and consistent experience when using the product.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some technology can really help you across a range of problem domains (I’ll blog about Cassandra for that in the future). But you should always be thinking (and testing!) about your choices, lest you end up using a shiny new hammer to solve problems that need a powerdrill.
&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="redis"></category><category term="mongodb"></category><category term="airG"></category></entry><entry><title>"Android Emulator 2.2 and Android Market"</title><link href="http://devslant.com/android-emulator-22-and-android-market.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-02T17:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Derek Rodger</name></author><id>tag:devslant.com,2010-11-02:android-emulator-22-and-android-market.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
One of the drawbacks to not having an actual Android phone (for now) is that I want to see what apps are available, but Google only has a sampling of what’s available on their &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/market/" title="Android Market" target="_blank"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;. I find that rather annoying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I do have the emulator, and in theory I should be able to do something with that. The emulator does not come with Market access, but there are system images of the virtual devices for v1.5 and 1.6.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have the v1.5, and it’s ok, but I wanted to see what was available for v2.2, which now has &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html" title="android versions" target="_blank"&gt;36% of all Android&lt;/a&gt; users on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I ended up using a ROM image from &lt;a href="http://android.modaco.com/content/google-nexus-one-nexusone-modaco-com/317849/22-oct-r24-modaco-custom-rom-desire-port-for-nexus-one-with-online-kitchen-2-2-froyo/" title="Modaco" target="_blank"&gt;modaco&lt;/a&gt; for the nexus one (note: link may require registration).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So here’s how it all comes together (note, I am using Windows below, but it’s nearly identical under Mac or Linux):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Create an Android 2.2 AVD&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the system.img that comes with the Android SDK to your new AVD folder. ex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
D:\android-sdk-windows\platforms\android-8\images\system.img
to
C:\Users\drodger\.android\avd\AndMarket22.avd\
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you’ll need to start the emulator, but you need to tell it how much internal storage to use (the default isn’t enough). In the AVD manager, select the New… button by the Hardware section, and scroll down and select the Device ram size property, and then edit the value to 128 (just click on the value). Here’s the command line version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\emulator -avd AndMarket22.avd -partition-size 128&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wait. Wait some more. The emulator is slow to load this one up sometimes. Don’t bother with the next step until the emulator has completely started.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Now you need to get the build.prop file from within the emulator image, and make a change, and push the change back, like so:
    &lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb pull /system/build.prop&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Now edit that file (it will now be in your tools\ directory), and comment out the following line by putting a '#' at the beginning of the line:
&lt;pre&gt;
ro.config.nocheckin=yes
#ro.config.nocheckin=yes
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Now you need to push it back:&lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb remount&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb push build.prop /system/build.prop&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Now you need the ROM you downloaded from modaco&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look within the zip, in the \system\app folder&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Copy GoogleServicesFramework.apk and Vending.apk to your tools\ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb push GoogleServicesFramework.apk /system/app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb push Vending.apk /system.app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Remove the SDK setup package:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;D:\android-sdk-windows\tools\adb shell rm /system/app/SdkSetup.apk&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Close the emulator&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Delete these files in your AVD directory: cache.img, userdata.img, userdata-qemu.img&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ok, now go start the emulator again, and you should be good to go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
